Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis with Seurat

This repository provides a workflow for the exploration and analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data using the R package Seurat (version 5.1.0). The pipeline includes essential steps such as quality control (QC), 
dimensionality reduction (UMAP, t-SNE), and statistical analysis, offering a comprehensive approach to scRNA-seq data analysis. This script is inspired by the official guidelines provided by the developers of Seurat and is enhanced
with personal modifications and additions based on practical experience from various projects. I would like to express my gratitude to the creators and maintainers of Seurat for their invaluable contributions to the field of bioinformatics. 
All credit for the development of Seurat belongs to its authors. This script is shared for educational and research purposes only.

Key Features of the Workflow of a typical scRNA-seq pipeline:
1) Data Preprocessing: Importing, filtering, and normalizing scRNA-seq data.
2) Quality Control (QC): Evaluating metrics such as gene count, unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), and mitochondrial content.
3) Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques such as UMAP and t-SNE for visualizing cellular heterogeneity.
4) Statistical Analysis: Differential expression analysis and cell cluster identification.

Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
The workflow is designed to analyze publicly available scRNA-seq datasets, which can be obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). GEO, a resource provided by NCBI, hosts an extensive collection of publicly available data from numerous projects.
Each dataset is typically associated with a GEO accession number (e.g., GSE200198), which is cited in the corresponding publication. These datasets, along with scripts shared by the authors, can be used to replicate and further explore their findings.

Getting Started
